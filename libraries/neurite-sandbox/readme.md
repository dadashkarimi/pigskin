- make sure to clone only the master branch, the legacy branch has a alot of space-consuming history:  
`git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/adalca/neurite-sandbox`

- This sandbox is meant for testing and experimenting with code involving the neuron toolbox. General code is usually moved to the public [neurite](https://github.com/adalca/neurite) repository but often starts here.
