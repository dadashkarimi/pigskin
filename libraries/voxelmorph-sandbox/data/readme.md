# Data paths

Pushing data to the git repo slows down the repository operation, so let's maintain most of the 
data on disks, and keep links here (either local absolute paths, or web links).

## T1-mix Data
LCN `/cluster/vxmdata1/FS_Slim/proc/cleaned/`  

About 30,000 T1 MPRAGE + the UK BioBank.  
These data are gathered from ~8 datasets, all processed through FS and some manual QA, all done by Mert. Some further processing and organization by Adrian and Andrew. Please cite the original study of each paper, as well as the first paper where this processing and analysis was introduced:
